# Asset Generation Tracker

Living checklist of **sprites and animations** to generate for `pb-td`. Update this document as assets move through generation, review, and Phaser integration.

**Related docs**

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`PIXELLAB-ASSET-GENERATION.md`](./PIXELLAB-ASSET-GENERATION.md) | Prompt templates, MCP workflow, quality bar |
| [`MONSTER-SYSTEMS-DEEP-DIVE.md`](./MONSTER-SYSTEMS-DEEP-DIVE.md) | Monster movement & defense behavior (what animations must support) |
| [`HANDOVER.md`](./HANDOVER.md) | Gem types, gameplay loop, combat |

## How to use this document

### Status values

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | Not started — needs prompt + generation |
| `generating` | PixelLab job queued or in progress |
| `review` | Candidates ready — pick best variant |
| `accepted` | Exported to `public/assets/` — passes quality bar |
| `integrated` | Preloaded in Phaser + verified in-game |

### Per-asset fields

When you complete an asset, fill in:

- **Job ID** — PixelLab MCP job / character ID
- **Candidate** — which variant or frame was selected
- **Prompt** — final prompt that worked (link or short excerpt)
- **Notes** — scale tweaks, reject reasons, integration quirks

### Generation order (recommended)

1. **Environment** — board must be readable before units
2. **One complete monster** (`stone-grunt`) — movement smoke test
3. **One tower family** (flame t1–t3) + projectile + hit FX
4. **Remaining vertical-slice assets** (see §Progress)
5. **Slice 2+** — deferred archetypes, more tiers, biomes

## Progress summary

_Update these counts when statuses change._

| Section | Total | Pending | Generating | Review | Accepted | Integrated |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Monsters | 24 | 24 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Towers | 30 | 30 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Projectiles | 6 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Particles / FX | 8 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Environment | 13 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **All** | **81** | **81** | **0** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

**Current focus:** Environment → Monsters → Towers → Projectiles / FX

---

## 1. Monsters and monster movement

Ground creeps use `walk` while Phaser advances position along the path. Flying creeps use `fly` + a separate `shadow` sprite. Movement speed is **content data**, not animation FPS.

**Shared animation contract**

| Animation | Frames | FPS | Loop | Origin |
| --- | ---: | ---: | :---: | --- |
| `walk` | 6–8 | 8–10 | yes | `[0.5, 0.75]` |
| `fly` | 6–8 | 8–12 | yes | `[0.5, 0.75]` |
| `hit` | 2–4 | 12–16 | no | `[0.5, 0.75]` |
| `death` | 6–10 | 10–14 | no | `[0.5, 0.75]` |
| `split` | 6–8 | 10–14 | no | `[0.5, 0.75]` |
| `spawn` | 6–10 | 8–12 | no | `[0.5, 0.75]` |
| `shadow` | 1 (static) | — | — | `[0.5, 0.5]` |

**Generation size:** 64×64 per frame (boss 96×96 or 128×128). **Render size:** 32–48px ground/flying; 64–96px boss.

### 1.1 Vertical slice (generate first)

### 1.3 Monster prompt cheat sheet

```text
top-down pixel art monster sprite for a GemTD-inspired fantasy crystal maze tower defense game, <description>, <role readability>, clean strong silhouette, single-color dark outline, medium shading, Warcraft 3 custom map readability, readable at 32 pixels, facing downward-right as default, transparent background, background removed, no square backdrop, no scene background, isolated sprite
```

| ID | Prompt focus |
| --- | --- |
| `crystal-runner` | Lean hunched body, narrow sprinting silhouette, fast low-health read |
| `stone-grunt` | Broad simple torso, baseline enemy, neutral threat |
| `shield-bulwark` | Large frontal shield or shell, armored slow read |
| `sky-warden` | Wings or hover body, flying enemy, small shadow separate asset |
| `gate-colossus` | Large crown/horns/core, boss scale, intimidating silhouette |
| `thorn-splitter` | Cracked pod or seed body, looks like it will burst |
| `arcane-mystic` | Robe, glow, staff — resistant caster read |

---

## 2. Towers, particles, and projectiles

Towers sit on `setOrigin(0.5, 1.0)`. Attacks are mostly in-place; **projectiles** carry direction. **Particles** are short one-shot bursts (pooled during waves).

**Tower animation contract**

| Animation | Frames | FPS | Loop | Origin |
| --- | ---: | ---: | :---: | --- |
| `idle` | 4–6 | 4–8 | yes | `[0.5, 1.0]` |
| `attack` | 4–8 | 10–16 | no | `[0.5, 1.0]` |
| `build` | 6–10 | 10–14 | no | `[0.5, 1.0]` |

**Generation size:** 64×64 basic gems; 96×96 special towers. **Render:** 40–56px basic; 56–72px special.

### 2.1 Tower families (vertical slice)

Five families in the art pipeline. Map to gameplay gem colors in content data later.

| Family | Color | Combat read | Gem TD analog (approx.) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `flame` | Red/orange | Splash / burn | Ruby |
| `stone` | Grey/gold | Heavy hits / slow | Diamond |
| `thorn` | Green | Poison DoT | Emerald |
| `arcane` | Violet/blue | Pierce / magic | Amethyst |
| `radiant` | Gold/white | Aura / support | Opal |

## 3. Environment, spawn gate, and goal

Terrain uses **32×32** tiles (`setOrigin(0, 0)`). Landmarks use **64×64** or **96×96** objects with `setOrigin(0.5, 1.0)`. The **data grid** decides pathing — art must not imply walkability.

### 3.1 Terrain tiles

| ID | Type | Export path | Phaser key | Tile size | Slice | Status | Job ID | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `default-floor` | seamless tile | `public/assets/terrain/tiles/default-floor.png` | `terrain.default-floor` | 32×32 | ✓ | pending | | Buildable ground |

| `blocked-floor` | seamless tile | `public/assets/terrain/tiles/blocked-floor.png` | `terrain.blocked-floor` | 32×32 | ✓ | pending | | Unbuildable cells |

**Terrain prompt**

```text
top-down seamless 32x32 pixel art terrain tile for a GemTD-inspired fantasy crystal maze, <description>, gameplay-readable stone floor, subtle detail only, no tall objects, no text, crisp pixel edges
```

### 3.2 Landmarks — spawn, goal, checkpoints
