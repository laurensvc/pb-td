# Board and Maze Specification

Authoritative design for the **playable map**, **mazing grid**, **camera**, **waypoint routing**, and **pathfinding** in the Gem TD-inspired clone (`pb-td`).

This document extends [`HANDOVER.md`](./HANDOVER.md) §2.3 and §5 with concrete rules. It incorporates:

- Classic **Warcraft III Gem TD** map research (≈148×148 playable, 5–7 checkpoints, 2×2 gem footprints, shortest-path routing).
- Project-specific UX: **large pannable map**, **grid only while placing gems**, **no visible creep path**, **grass environment**, **visible landmarks** at spawn, goal, and checkpoints.

**Status:** Design specification. Map JSON and Phaser scene code are not yet committed.

## 1. Design goals

| Goal | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| **Large battlefield** | Map is much larger than the viewport; player pans to plan mazes. |
| **Natural look** | Grass terrain reads as an open field, not a painted lane TD. |
| **Hidden path** | Creep route is **not** drawn on the ground. Mazing creates the path implicitly. |
| **Visible key points** | Spawn gate, goal nexus, and numbered checkpoints are always visible landmarks. |
| **Grid on demand** | Placement grid appears **only** during gem placement in the build phase. |
| **Data authority** | Walkability and buildability come from the **logic grid**, never from terrain art. |
| **Gem TD fidelity** | Shortest-path routing through ordered checkpoints; 2×2 structures; anti-block validation. |

### 1.1 Player experience summary

```text
Combat / explore  →  grass field, landmarks, towers, rocks, monsters — no grid, no path overlay
Build (place gem) →  grid fades in, ghost gem snaps to 2×2 cells, valid/invalid rings
Build (other)     →  grid hidden again during select / resolve / combat
```

---

## 2. Classic Gem TD reference

Research from WC3 Gem TD (v5.x), Gem TD+, and community mazing guides:

| Property | Classic behavior | Clone adoption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Playable area | ~**148×148** tiles (160×160 total with border) | **148×148** logic grid for v1 |
| Checkpoints | **5–7** ordered waypoints + spawn + goal | **5 checkpoints** v1 (extendable to 7) |
| Structure size | Gems and rocks occupy **2×2** cells | **2×2** footprint for gems, rocks, towers |
| Routing | Shortest walkable path between consecutive checkpoints | Same — A* per leg |
| Checkpoint blocking | Cannot fully seal a checkpoint | Anti-block validation on every leg |
| Unbuildable zones | Spawn wall, diagonal border, checkpoint pads, final approach lane | Modeled as `unbuildable` cells |
| Flying creeps | Ignore maze; follow fixed aerial route through center **twice** | Logical spline through checkpoints; **not** drawn on grass |
| Path visibility | Classic maps sometimes show a gray aerial lane | **Intentionally omitted** — landmarks only |

**Mazing strategy (classic):** Players surround odd or even checkpoints (often 1, 3, 5), use map walls as borders, and spiral outward from the center cross so towers get maximum exposure time.

---

## 3. Map dimensions and coordinates

### 3.1 Grid constants

```ts
const TILE_SIZE = 32;           // pixels per logic cell
const MAP_WIDTH = 148;          // logic cells (x)
const MAP_HEIGHT = 148;         // logic cells (y)
const WORLD_WIDTH = 4736;       // MAP_WIDTH * TILE_SIZE
const WORLD_HEIGHT = 4736;
const GEM_FOOTPRINT = 2;        // 2×2 cells per gem / rock / tower base
```

### 3.2 Coordinate system

| Space | Origin | Axes | Units |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Grid** | Top-left `(0, 0)` | `gx`, `gy` | Integer cells |
| **World** | Top-left `(0, 0)` | `x`, `y` | Pixels |
| **Footprint** | Top-left cell of 2×2 | `gx`, `gy` | Must be even-aligned (see §7) |

```ts
function gridToWorldCenter(gx: number, gy: number) {
  return {
    x: gx * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2,
    y: gy * TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE / 2,
  };
}

function worldToGrid(x: number, y: number) {
  return {
    gx: Math.floor(x / TILE_SIZE),
    gy: Math.floor(y / TILE_SIZE),
  };
}
```

### 3.3 Default map: `crownfall-grass` (v1)

Proposed landmark positions on the 148×148 grid (tunable in content JSON):

| Landmark | ID | Grid top-left (gx, gy) | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spawn gate | `spawn` | `(8, 124)` | Creep entry (Point A) |
| Checkpoint 1 | `checkpoint-1` | `(68, 68)` | Center cross (main hub) |
| Checkpoint 2 | `checkpoint-2` | `(108, 48)` | Upper-right arm |
| Checkpoint 3 | `checkpoint-3` | `(48, 48)` | Upper-left arm |
| Checkpoint 4 | `checkpoint-4` | `(108, 88)` | Lower-right arm |
| Checkpoint 5 | `checkpoint-5` | `(48, 88)` | Lower-left arm |
| Goal nexus | `goal` | `(124, 8)` | Leak target (Point B) |

```text
                    GOAL (124,8)
                         ★
          CP3 (48,48)              CP2 (108,48)
               ◆                        ◆

                    CP1 (68,68)
                         ◆
          CP5 (48,88)              CP4 (108,88)
               ◆                        ◆

    SPAWN (8,124)
         ⛩
```

**v1 route order** (ground creeps):

```text
spawn → checkpoint-1 → checkpoint-2 → checkpoint-1 → checkpoint-3
      → checkpoint-1 → checkpoint-4 → checkpoint-1 → checkpoint-5
      → checkpoint-1 → goal
```

This is a **superset** of the simplified HANDOVER loop (`Start → WP1 → WP2 → WP1 → End`) and closer to classic multi-checkpoint play. Content can ship a shorter `v1-simple` route with fewer legs for early prototyping.

**Checkpoint pad size:** Each checkpoint occupies a **3×3 unbuildable** cell region centered on the coordinate above (footprint anchor = top-left of pad). Spawn and goal use **4×4** landmark pads.

---

## 4. Visual vs logical layers

The map is split into layers with strict responsibilities.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Visual["Visual layers (Phaser)"]
        Terrain["Grass terrain tilemap"]
        Decor["Optional decor (trees, flowers) — cosmetic only"]
        Structures["Gems, rocks, towers"]
        Landmarks["Spawn, goal, checkpoint objects"]
        Units["Monsters, projectiles, FX"]
        GridOverlay["Grid overlay — build phase only"]
    end

    subgraph Logic["Logic layers (sim / content)"]
        Walk["Walkability grid"]
        Build["Buildability grid"]
        Block["Blocking grid (rocks + gems)"]
        Route["Waypoint graph + path cache"]
    end

    Logic --> Visual
```

### 4.1 What players see vs what sim uses

| Element | Visible | Affects pathfinding |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Grass terrain | ✓ | ✗ |
| Trees / decor | ✓ (optional) | ✗ |
| Spawn / goal / checkpoints | ✓ | ✓ (pad cells unbuildable) |
| Creep path / lane paint | **✗** | ✓ (computed) |
| Placement grid | Build phase only | ✓ |
| Rocks and gems | ✓ | ✓ |
| Flying route line | **✗** | ✓ (spline through checkpoints) |

**Rule:** If grass art looks like a path, that is cosmetic only. Never use terrain paint to communicate walkability.

### 4.2 Layer render order (bottom → top)

```text
1. Grass terrain tilemap
2. Cosmetic decor (optional, y-sorted)
3. Checkpoint / spawn / goal landmarks
4. Rocks, gems, towers (y-sorted)
5. Monsters + shadows
6. Projectiles and particles
7. Grid overlay + placement rings (build phase only)
8. UI-attached world hints (leak warning, etc.)
```

---

## 5. Camera and navigation

The map (4736×4736 px at 32 px tiles) is **always larger than the viewport**. The camera pans across the grass field; it does not scale the whole map to fit on screen during gameplay.

### 5.1 Viewport assumptions

| Property | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Viewport | 1280×720 (responsive; maintain aspect) |
| Initial camera | Centered on **checkpoint-1** (maze heart) |
| Zoom | **1.0** fixed for v1 (no zoom slider) |
| Bounds | Camera clamped to `[0, WORLD_WIDTH]` × `[0, WORLD_HEIGHT]` |

### 5.2 Mouse panning

| Input | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Middle mouse drag** | Pan camera (primary) |
| **Space + left mouse drag** | Pan camera (accessibility alternate) |
| **Mouse at screen edge** | Optional edge-scroll during build phase only |

During gem placement, panning must not accidentally place gems — require explicit click on a valid cell after panning.

### 5.3 Keyboard panning

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `W` / `↑` | Pan up |
| `A` / `←` | Pan left |
| `S` / `↓` | Pan down |
| `D` / `→` | Pan right |
| `Home` | Jump camera to spawn |
| `End` | Jump camera to goal |
| `C` | Center on checkpoint-1 |

Pan speed: **900 px/s** held, with acceleration optional in polish pass.

### 5.4 Build-phase camera assist

When the player enters gem placement for the current round:

1. Fade in grid overlay (§6).
2. Optionally **soft-focus** nearest empty buildable region — never force camera; assist only.
3. On invalid hover near map edge, allow edge-scroll.

---

## 6. Grid visibility and build UX

### 6.1 When the grid is visible

| Game phase | Grid visible | Placement rings |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Build — placing gems | ✓ | ✓ (`selection-ring` / `invalid-ring`) |
| Build — selecting gem to keep | ✗ | ✗ |
| Resolve (gems → rocks) | ✗ | ✗ |
| Combat | ✗ | ✗ |
| Free camera explore (if allowed) | ✗ | ✗ |

### 6.2 Grid overlay spec

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Cell size | 32×32 px (matches `TILE_SIZE`) |
| Color | Faint neutral line, ~15% opacity |
| 2×2 highlight | Stronger border on hovered footprint |
| Even alignment | Ghost snaps to `(gx, gy)` where both are even |
| Valid hover | `selection-ring` at footprint center |
| Invalid hover | `invalid-ring` + red ghost tint |

```ts
// Snap hover to 2×2 footprint top-left (even coordinates)
function snapFootprint(gridX: number, gridY: number) {
  return {
    gx: Math.floor(gridX / 2) * 2,
    gy: Math.floor(gridY / 2) * 2,
  };
}
```

### 6.3 Ghost gem preview

- Semi-transparent gem sprite at snapped footprint.
- Runs anti-block validation (§10) on hover — updates ring color.
- Shows footprint occupancy (2×2 blocked preview) without committing.

---

## 7. Cell types and build rules

### 7.1 Logic cell enum

```ts
type CellKind =
  | 'buildable_grass'     // player may place 2×2 gems during build
  | 'blocked'             // rock, gem, or tower — impassable + unbuildable
  | 'unbuildable'         // border, checkpoint pad, spawn/goal pad, bypass lane
  | 'checkpoint_pad'      // unbuildable; must remain reachable
  | 'spawn_pad'
  | 'goal_pad'
  | 'forced_walkable';    // bypass corridors (border exploit prevention)
```

### 7.2 Initial board fill

At match start, all interior cells default to `buildable_grass` except:

| Zone | Cell kind | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Map outer border (2-cell rim) | `unbuildable` | Visual cliff/wall optional |
| Spawn pad | `spawn_pad` | Near `(8, 124)` |
| Goal pad | `goal_pad` | Near `(124, 8)` |
| Checkpoint pads ×5 | `checkpoint_pad` | 3×3 each |
| Diagonal bypass strip | `forced_walkable` | Prevents sealing spawn corner (classic) |
| Goal approach lane | `unbuildable` | Last leg corridor — build alongside, not on (classic WP7→B rule) |

### 7.3 Placement validity (build phase)

A 2×2 footprint at `(gx, gy)` is legal only if:

1. All four cells are `buildable_grass`.
2. Footprint does not overlap landmarks or unbuildable zones.
3. **Anti-block:** temporary place → all route legs still have A* paths (§10).
4. Player has remaining gem placements this round (max 5).

### 7.4 Resolution phase

When the player selects one gem to keep:

- Chosen footprint → **tower** (`blocked`, attacks).
- Other four placements → **rocks** (`blocked`, passive wall).

Rocks and gems both block ground movement. Towers block movement and shoot.

---

## 8. Landmarks and waypoint route

### 8.1 Visible landmarks

Landmarks are **always rendered** on the grass field:

| Asset ID | Visual | Readable at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spawn-gate` | Stone gate / portal | Zoomed out minimap |
| `goal-nexus` | Crystal castle core | Zoomed out minimap |
| `checkpoint-1` … `checkpoint-5` | Numbered rune stones | Must read **number** at 100% zoom |

Landmarks are not the path — they are **routing nodes**. Ground creeps path toward node centers; players maze between them.

### 8.2 Waypoint graph

```ts
interface WaypointNode {
  id: string;
  grid: { gx: number; gy: number };
  world: { x: number; y: number };
  padSize: number;              // 3 for CP, 4 for spawn/goal
  landmarkKey: string;          // Phaser texture key
}

interface RouteLeg {
  from: string;
  to: string;
}

interface BoardRoute {
  id: string;
  groundLegs: RouteLeg[];       // ordered A* segments
  flyingNodes: string[];        // ordered nodes for aerial spline
}
```

**Default `groundLegs` for `crownfall-grass`:**

```json
[
  { "from": "spawn", "to": "checkpoint-1" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-1", "to": "checkpoint-2" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-2", "to": "checkpoint-1" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-1", "to": "checkpoint-3" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-3", "to": "checkpoint-1" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-1", "to": "checkpoint-4" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-4", "to": "checkpoint-1" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-1", "to": "checkpoint-5" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-5", "to": "checkpoint-1" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-1", "to": "goal" }
]
```

### 8.3 Prototype shortcut route

For early engine tests, ship `crownfall-simple`:

```json
[
  { "from": "spawn", "to": "checkpoint-1" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-1", "to": "checkpoint-2" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-2", "to": "checkpoint-1" },
  { "from": "checkpoint-1", "to": "goal" }
]
```

---

## 9. Mazing and blocking rules

### 9.1 Wall connectivity (classic)

Enemies cannot pass through 2×2 structures. Adjacent structures form walls when:

- **Edge-adjacent** (share a side), or
- **Corner-adjacent** (touching diagonally at corners)

A single 1-cell gap is enough for creeps to squeeze through — mazes should be tight intentionally.

### 9.2 Checkpoint sealing

Players **cannot** place rocks/gems such that any checkpoint becomes unreachable. Validation runs per §10.

Checkpoint **pads** are unbuildable — players cannot accidentally build on the checkpoint itself (classic fairness rule).

### 9.3 Border exploits

Classic maps prevent maze shortcuts along:

| Exploit | Prevention |
| --- | --- |
| Spawn wall hug | `unbuildable` + `forced_walkable` bypass strip along spawn edge |
| Diagonal map border | Unbuildable diagonal band |
| Goal approach | `unbuildable` lane on final approach — towers may build beside it |

### 9.4 Structure occupancy map

Maintain `blocking[][]` derived from all `blocked` cells:

```ts
function rebuildBlocking(grid: BoardGrid): void {
  for (let gy = 0; gy < MAP_HEIGHT; gy++) {
    for (let gx = 0; gx < MAP_WIDTH; gx++) {
      blocking[gy][gx] = grid.cells[gy][gx] === 'blocked' ? 1 : 0;
    }
  }
}
```

Walkability for ground creeps: `0 = walkable`, `1 = blocked`, except `forced_walkable` always `0`.

---

## 10. Pathfinding and path cache

### 10.1 Algorithm

- **Library:** EasyStar.js (A*).
- **Per leg:** Run from `from` node center → `to` node center on current walkability grid.
- **Diagonal movement:** Disabled (4-directional) for predictable Gem TD mazes.
- **Heuristic:** Manhattan distance.

### 10.2 Anti-blocking validation

On hover / placement attempt:

```ts
function canPlaceFootprint(grid: BoardGrid, gx: number, gy: number): boolean {
  if (!isFootprintBuildable(grid, gx, gy)) return false;

  const trial = cloneGrid(grid);
  setFootprint(trial, gx, gy, 'blocked');

  for (const leg of route.groundLegs) {
    const path = findPath(trial, leg.from, leg.to);
    if (path === null) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

UI feedback: invalid ring + disabled click.

### 10.3 Path cache (performance)

> Calculate the path **once** when the maze changes. Creeps follow cached world coordinates.

```ts
interface PathCache {
  version: number;
  legs: WorldCoord[][];
  concatenated: WorldCoord[];
  legStartIndex: number[];
  totalLength: number;
}
```

**Invalidate** when: build phase resolves (new rocks), gem combine changes footprint, debug map edit.

**Do not invalidate** on: creep death, projectile hit, camera pan.

### 10.4 Path progress

```ts
pathProgress = legIndexOffset + pathIndex + distanceAlongSegment;
```

Use for tower targeting "closest to end" (see `HANDOVER.md` §6.1).

---

## 11. Flying route (invisible path)

Flying creeps **ignore** `blocking` grid. They follow a **fixed spline** through waypoint world positions.

### 11.1 Visibility rule

| Classic Gem TD | This project |
| --- | --- |
| Gray aerial lane sometimes visible | **No lane art** — grass only |
| Center crossed twice | Same logic — spline visits `checkpoint-1` twice |

Players infer the aerial route from **checkpoint positions** and wave announcements ("flying wave").

### 11.2 Flying spline (v1)

```ts
const flyingNodes = [
  'spawn',
  'checkpoint-1',
  'checkpoint-2',
  'checkpoint-1',
  'checkpoint-3',
  'checkpoint-1',
  'goal',
];

// Catmull-Rom or polyline through node world centers
// Sample to ~2px spacing for smooth movement
```

### 11.3 Debug overlay (dev only)

`?debugPaths=1` may draw:

- Ground path polyline (green)
- Flying spline (blue, dashed)

**Never** enabled in production builds.

---

## 12. Grass environment art direction

### 12.1 Visual theme

| Property | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| Biome | **Grass** — green field, subtle variation |
| Tile | 32×32 seamless `grass-floor` (replaces stone `default-floor` in art tracker) |
| Path tiles | **Not used visually** in v1 |
| Mood | Open meadow with crystal landmarks — not dungeon stone |

### 12.2 Terrain tiles (v1)

| ID | Purpose | Visible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grass-floor` | Buildable meadow | ✓ |
| `grass-variant-a` | Break repetition (optional autotile) | ✓ |
| `grass-edge` | Map border blend (optional) | ✓ |
| `blocked-floor` | Debug / editor only | ✗ in shipping |
| `path-floor` | **Not rendered** — logic/debug only | ✗ |

### 12.3 Decor (optional, cosmetic)

- Small flowers, stones, tufts — **do not** affect grid.
- Place with density cap so readability stays high.
- Avoid decor on checkpoint pads and spawn/goal.

### 12.4 Landmark contrast

Landmarks must pop against grass:

- Spawn gate: stone + portal glow.
- Goal nexus: crystal / gold core.
- Checkpoints: numbered stone runes, darker base ring.

---

## 13. Content data schema

```ts
// packages/content/src/boards/crownfall-grass.json

interface BoardDefinition {
  id: string;
  displayName: string;
  tileSize: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;

  terrain: {
    baseTileKey: string;          // "terrain.grass-floor"
    decorKeys?: string[];
  };

  landmarks: WaypointNode[];
  route: BoardRoute;

  zones: {
    unbuildable: GridRect[];
    forcedWalkable: GridRect[];
    goalApproachLane: GridRect[];
    diagonalBypass: GridRect[];
  };

  camera: {
    startFocus: string;           // "checkpoint-1"
    bounds: [number, number, number, number];
  };
}

interface GridRect {
  gx: number;
  gy: number;
  w: number;
  h: number;
}
```

Ship two route profiles in content:

- `crownfall-grass` — full checkpoint loop (production).
- `crownfall-simple` — shortened loop (engine QA).

---

## 14. Phaser implementation notes

### 14.1 Scene structure

```text
BoardScene
├── CameraController      (pan, bounds, keyboard)
├── TerrainLayer          (grass tilemap, no path paint)
├── DecorLayer            (optional)
├── LandmarkLayer         (spawn, goal, checkpoints)
├── StructureLayer        (gems, rocks, towers — y-sort)
├── UnitLayer             (monsters)
├── FxLayer               (projectiles, particles)
└── BuildOverlayLayer     (grid + rings — visible build-place only)
```

### 14.2 Grid overlay implementation

```ts
class BuildOverlayLayer extends Phaser.GameObjects.Container {
  setVisibleForPhase(phase: GamePhase, subphase: BuildSubphase) {
    const show = phase === 'build' && subphase === 'placing';
    this.setVisible(show);
  }
}
```

Draw grid with `Graphics` object or pre-baked tile sprite — avoid 21,904 individual GameObjects (148²).

### 14.3 Landmark placement

```ts
landmark.setOrigin(0.5, 1.0);
landmark.setDepth(landmark.y + LANDMARK_DEPTH_OFFSET);
```

### 14.4 Pixel art config

```ts
render: { pixelArt: true, roundPixels: true }
```

## 15. Asset implications

Updates to the art pipeline based on this spec:

| Change | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Grass replaces stone floor | Generate `grass-floor` as primary terrain |
| No visible path | **Do not** ship `path-floor` in v1 visuals; keep for debug optional |
| Landmarks required | Prioritize `spawn-gate`, `goal-nexus`, `checkpoint-1`–`5` |
| Grid rings | `selection-ring`, `invalid-ring` for build UX |
| Large map | Tilemap size 148×148; test camera pan early |

See [`PIXELLAB-ASSET-GENERATION.md`](./PIXELLAB-ASSET-GENERATION.md) §9 and asset tracker environment section when merged.

---

## 16. Open decisions

| # | Question | Recommendation |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Full 5-checkpoint loop vs simple 3-leg route for first playable | Start `crownfall-simple`, switch to full loop for beta |
| 2 | Minimap for large map | Yes — react overlay showing landmarks + camera rect |
| 3 | Zoom levels | Defer — fixed 1.0 until playtest |
| 4 | 7 checkpoints (SC2 layout) | Content schema supports N nodes; art ships 5 first |
| 5 | Decor density | Low for v1 — readability over beauty |
| 6 | Edge scroll vs only keyboard/middle-mouse | Build phase edge scroll optional |
